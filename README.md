official github repo for this paper.

Abstract:
Radio Resource Management (RRM) in wireless
networks faces several challenges related to balancing complex
optimization, stringent QoS, and tight convergence time. Traditional heuristics are computationally expensive, while learning
methods frequently struggle with constraint enforcement. In
this paper, we propose a two-stage hybrid framework for D2D
power and RB allocation. First, a Variational Graph Autoencoder
(VGAE) models channel state information (CSI) as a graph
to learn and generate diverse, high-quality feasible allocations.
These initialize a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for refinement. The
proposed hybrid approach combines the generative power of
VGAE with the fine-tuning ability of GA, achieving faster
convergence, improved constraint satisfaction, and near-optimal
performance with reduced computational cost.
